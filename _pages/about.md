Iâ€™m a fourth-year PhD student from the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department of the University of Florida. My research areas are SoC security, hardware verification and trusted execution verification.

My passion is researching about the security of software and hardware domains. While understanding existing security vulnerabilities in a design I am also keen on identifying new threats and vulnerabilities that are not yet discovered. My main interest is to automatically detect vulnerabilities with minimal effort.
